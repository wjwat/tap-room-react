      #   # I'm not sure the first line of this command is necessary. As I understand it
      #   # gh-pages (`npm run deploy`) should build the site then make a commit
      #   # directly to my `gh-pages` branch. But what's happening is it builds it
      #   # and then nothing. Adding the `Deploy` action underneath fixes this
      #   # but I don't know why.
